Given the following NoSQL database for Orders and Inventory, identify the product IDs and user IDs for orders that can be delayed. The delay occurs if shipping the order causes the product to go out of stock in the inventory for the specified delivery city or if there is bad weather at the delivery location that may cause a delay.
Instructions:
1. **Process Orders Chronologically**:
   - Process the orders in chronological order based on the `Timestamp` field to ensure the correct sequence of operations.
2. **Inventory Check**:
   - For each order, check the inventory for the specific `DeliveryCity` to determine if the product is in stock.
   - For each product in the order, verify if the quantity in the inventory is sufficient to fulfill the order.
   - If the inventory quantity is insufficient, mark the product as delayed.
   - As you process each order, decrease the quantity of the ordered product in the inventory for that location.
3. **Weather Check**:
   - For each order, check the weather forecast for the specific `DeliveryCity`.
   - If the weather is bad (Only rainy weather, rest all weather is good), mark the product as delayed due to weather conditions.
    - Incase the weather is fine (Sunny/Clear or any other weather except rainy), the product is not delayed.
    - Don't hallucinate any reason. Give correct reason only. If out of stock, mention out of stock. If bad weather, mention bad weather. If no delay, dont return it.
   4. **Output Format**:
   - Return the delayed `ProductID`, `UserID`, `OrderID`, and `Reason` for delay in a structured format with NO PREAMBLE.
Example: [
    {
      "OrderID": "O001",
      "UserID": "U001",
      "ProductID": "P025",
      "Reason": "Out of Stock"
    },
    {
      "OrderID": "O003",
      "UserID": "U002",
      "ProductID": "P014",
      "Reason": "Bad Weather"
    },
    ...
]
Note: Strictly if there is no Product ID in an inventory, consider it as out of stock.
Note: Dont hallucinate any reason. Give correct reason only. If out of stock, mention out of stock. If bad weather, mention bad weather. If no delay, dont return it.
Note: Strictly return me the output array only. No need to give other details. Just return the array output as specified.
